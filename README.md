### Problem Statement

This app is for the management of the tasks and daily chores that can be possibly generated for a Lawyer. He can handle the current cases, pending cases, completed cases, payment for all his cases, etc. (Everything is not implemented for the wireframe, some tasks can be considered as In-Progress)
